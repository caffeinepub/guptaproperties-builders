REQ-5 cannot be confirmed as complete from the diff because the updated DEPLOYMENT_RETRY.md content shown is truncated/garbled and does not visibly include the required end-to-end draft+live procedure and verification checklist details.",

      "reason": "The diff excerpt for `frontend/DEPLOYMENT_RETRY.md` is truncated/incorrectly structured (it cuts off right after 'Step 1' and then shows unrelated content), so the required concrete steps for clean install/build, deploying canisters, deploying the frontend, repeating for both draft and live, and the explicit verification checklist referencing the bootstrap principal cannot be verified as present.",
