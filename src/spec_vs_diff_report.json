  "summary": "The diff updates backend authorization/admin management wiring in `backend/main.mo` but does not show any explicit, persistent grant of `#admin` to the specified principal. It also modifies `project_state.json`, which is not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Internet Identity principal `fxms2-qslpu-4ybaz-kouy4-mpule-mqqq5-7grvy-gyikf-o6pvz-zqvgd-hqe` is granted the `#admin` role in the backend admin system, without removing or replacing any existing admins.",
      "reason": "In the visible diff for `backend/main.mo`, there is no code that assigns `#admin` to the specified principal (e.g., via initialization/default admin list or state update). Only generic `grantAdmin`/`revokeAdmin` methods are shown, which require an existing admin to call them, and do not ensure the specific principal is admin by default.",

      "requirement": "Apply the admin grant for principal `fxms2-qslpu-4ybaz-kouy4-mpule-mqqq5-7grvy-gyikf-o6pvz-zqvgd-hqe` in a way that persists across canister upgrades and is applied consistently in both draft and production deployments.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any stable-state handling or conditional migration ensuring the specified principal remains an admin after upgrades. No `backend/migration.mo` is added, and no upgrade hooks or stable variable patterns are evidenced in the truncated `backend/main.mo` snippet.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced/updated a `project_state.json` structure with new_feature_requests entries (AR-1/AR-2/AR-3) marked pending.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not request tracking changes in `project_state.json` or adding AR-* request metadata; it only asks for backend admin grant behavior.",
